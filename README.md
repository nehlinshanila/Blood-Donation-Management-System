BLOOD DONATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ðŸ©¸

This is a group collaboration of our CSE311 course final project. Blood Donation Management system is a web-based system that helps the users with
the information of different blood types and how they can be utilized in the blood bank to help several clients that are in need. We are using HTML, CSS,
Javascript and PHP to construct and create the website and I am heavily focusing on the Design and the Frontend aspect of it.
